# Things you might add to DEFS (configure usually figures out what to do):
# -DGNU_STANDARD        Behave as gzip even if invoked as gunzip (GNU standard)
# -DPROTO		Force function prototypes even if __STDC__ not defined
# -DDEBUG		Debug code
# -DDYN_ALLOC		Use dynamic allocation of large data structures
# -DRECORD_IO           read() and write() are rounded to record sizes.
# -DNO_SIZE_CHECK       stat() does not give a reliable file size
